# Robo Returns
>A spy of China has been arrested from India yesterday..
While he was taking to the jail he some how ran away..
We have his photo but his name is not being known by any of the person..
From our sources, we have come to know that the name of the person is in this webpage...
You are a CBI agent and you have to find the name..

Visiting this site we are welcomed to a clone of the amazon webpage, unfortunately signed out so no info there.

After a bit of prodding around I checked robots.txt, another very common place for ctf's to hide some useful info.

Just from looking at this it doesn't take long to notice **johnwick**'s name right there.

`HACSEC{johnwick}`
